# JKOSC - JK Open Source Community 
A community of developers run by the students of JK Institute of Applied Physics and Technology. 

## Community Statement
We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to actively participate, but we recognize and encourage the involvement of all kinds. We facilitate and foster access and empowerment. We are all learners.
In practice:
- We are not coding snobs. We do not assume knowledge or imply there are things that somebody should know.
- We insist on actively engaging with requests for feedback regardless of their complexity.
- We welcome newcomers and prioritize the education of others. We strive to approach all tasks with the enthusiasm of a newcomer. Because we believe that newcomers are just as valuable in this effort as experts.
- We consistently make the effort to actively recognize and validate multiple types of contributions.
- We are always willing to offer help or guidance.

## Anatomy of Open Source Projects 
Every open source organization is different, you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles to be completely different..

A typical open source project has the following types of people:

**Author:** The person/s or organization that created the project

**Owner:** The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository

**Maintainers:** Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project

**Contributors:** Everyone who has contributed something to the project

**Community Members:** People who use the project

A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.

**LICENSE:** By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.

**README:** The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.

**CONTRIBUTING:** Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.

**CODE_OF_CONDUCT:** The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants‚Äô behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.

Finally, open source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.

**Issue tracker:** Where people discuss issues related to the project.

**Pull requests:** Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.

**Discussion forums or mailing lists:** Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics. Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.

**Synchronous chat channel:** Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.

## GitHub Issue Flow 
:octocat: Every open source organization is different but you can take a hint from following instructions.

Known bugs and intended new features are tracked using GitHub issues. Issue labels are used to sort issues into categories, such as those which are suitable for beginners.

If you'd like to start working on an existing issue, comment on the issue that you plan to work on it so other contributors know it's being handled and can offer help.

Once you have completed your work on this issue, submit a pull request (PR) against the main branch. In the description field of the PR, include "resolves #XXXX" tagging the issue you are fixing. If the PR addresses the issue but doesn't completely resolve it (i.e. the issue should remain open after your PR is merged), write "addresses #XXXX".

If you discover a bug or have an idea for a new feature you'd like to add, begin by submitting an issue. Please do not simply submit a pull request containing the fix or new feature without making an issue first, we will probably not be able to accept it. Once you have gotten some feedback on the issue and a go ahead to address it, you can follow the process above to contribute the fix or feature.

## Contributors
We recognize all types of contributions. This project follows the all-contributors specification. Instructions to add yourself or add contribution emojis to your name are here. You can also post an issue or comment with the text: @all-contributors please add @YOUR-USERNAME for THING(S) and our nice bot will add you.
